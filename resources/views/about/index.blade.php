        <p>Hi, I’m Phil Mareu. I am a professional web designer and developer with almost 10 years of experience. I strive to build the best UI/UX for web applications and drive it with sensible coding practices and techniques. When I’m not building web things you can find me playing disc golf, hiking, or enjoying a tasty beverage while BBQing.</p>

        <p>In 2014, I married Bailey DeReus and we both legally changed our last name to Mareu. Mareu is a mash-up of my previous last name "Martinez" and her maiden name "DeReus". We both work remotely from our laptops and last year decided to hit the road full-time. Today, we both travel the U.S. while doing great things on the web. We sometimes blog at mareulife.com.</p>
